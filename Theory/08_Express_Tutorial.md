# Express tutorial

## Project: Local Library

We will create a Project called Local Library, which consists in a online catalog for a small library, where users can browser books and manage their account. This will cover:

- Use the Express Application Generator tool to create a skeleton website and application.
- Start and stop the Node web server.
- Use a database to store your application's data.
- Create routes for requesting different information, and templates ("views") to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser.
- Work with forms.
- Deploy your application to production.

## Basic installations

1. Install Express Application Generator

```bash
npm install express-generator -g
```

2. Create the project folder (`locallibrary`) and use the view engine `pug`.

```bash
express locallibrary --view=pug
```

```bash
npm install express-generator -g
```

```bash
npm install express-generator -g
```
